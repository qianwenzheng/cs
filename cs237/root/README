These computational resources are useful for verifying circuit design work.
     README      - this file
     Makefile	 - the instructions for making sqrt and csqrt
     sqrt.c	 - the driver for the root routine
     root.s	 - an assembly language implementation (only useful on Linux)
     root.pdf    - the lab handout

To build the system: 
     make csqrt

To build assembly version:
     make asqrt
