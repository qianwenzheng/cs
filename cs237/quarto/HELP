                                QUARTO
                     by Blaise Muller, (c) Gigamic

  Quarto is a board game with 16 pieces each of which uniquely combines 4
binary traits. Players receive unplayed pieces from their opponent and place
them strategically on the board.  A win occurs when a row, column, or diagonal
of 4 played pieces share some characteristic.
  In this implementation, the pieces are the hexadecimal values 0 through F.
The four traits are simply the bits that make up the values.  A win occurs
when a player completes a row, column, or diagonal using values that share a
binary digit value.
  A player's turn begins when they receive an unused hex digit. The player then:
    1. Places the digit by moving the board cursor (a highlighted square) and
       then typing space.
    2. Selects one of the remaining pieces (shown below the board) by typing
       the apropriate hexadecimal digit.
  Play continues until a win or draw.
